## image pipeline
Basic pipeline in NextFlow illustrating the ability to transfer and process images through a nextflow workflow. This pipeline takes in some cat images (dummy images) and reverses and inverse colours them. The important aspect of this pipeline is that it's a minimal DSL2 pipeline with samplesheet checking that can serve as a precursor to an image processing pipeline.
